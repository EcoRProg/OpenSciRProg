##Willingness to Share Research Data Is Related to the Strength of the Evidence and the Quality of Reporting of Statistical Results

###Abstract

**Background:** The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors’ fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.


**Methods and Findings:** We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a  bearing on statistical significance.

**Conclusions:** Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.

##Massive volumes of data

  1.Ecologistslack a culture of data sharing
  
  2.Treat data as an enduring product of research
  
  3.Basicaly to address large-scale questions
  
##Action items for individual ecologists

  1.Organize, document, and preserve data for posterity
  
  2.Share data
  
  3.Collaborate with networks of colleagues to bring together heterogeneous datasets to address larger scale questions 4.Address data management issues with students and peers
  
  
##Conclusions

  * Ecology can make critical contributions to large-scale environmental questions and close many knowledge gaps that are likely to persist in big-science initiatives, but only if ecologists are willing to participate in the big-data landscape

Como dice Carly Strasser :


## Introduction

### An open mind on open data

Scientists who are cautious about open science can start small by sharing data for a project that they have already completed. Specialists in the field offer this advice:

* Document a data-deposition plan while working on publications, so that the data and the paper will be ready for publication at the same time. It is not necessary, however, to release data alongside a paper, unless a funder mandates it.

* Craft a very explicit statement about data reuse — including who can use the data, how to use them and how to attribute them.

* Machine-readable data will be most easily combined with other data sets. Avoid proprietary data formats, such as Microsoft spreadsheets, or colour-coded cells that are
readable only by humans.

* Permanently archive data in reputable repositories such as FigShare or Zenodo, not
on a personal website.

* If you choose to share data from a new project, make sure to generate the
relevant metadata as you go. It is very hard to reconstruct important details after the fact. Tools such as those on Zenodo enable researchers to document such details throughout a project, so that all you have to do is flip a switch when you are ready
to share.

### Una frase aleatoria de Good enough practices in scientific computing

An old joke says that doing the research is the first 90% of any project; _writing up is the other 90%_


##Results

###Responses to Data Requests

Total 49 corresponding authors:
  *21 had shared some data with Wicherts et al. 
  *13 corresponding authors failed to respond to the request or any of the two reminders.
  *3 corresponding authors refused to share data either because the data were lost or because they lacked      time to retrieve the data and write a codebook.
  * 12 corresponding authors promised to share data at a later date, but have not done so in the
    past six years (we did not follow up on it). 
    
These authors commonly indicated that the data were not readily available or that they first needed to       write a codebook

### Resumen
La hipótesis de saturación de nitrógeno (N) sugiere que cuando un ecosistema alcanza la saturación de N, la entrada continua de N provocará una mayor lixiviación de N, emisión de óxido nitroso (N2O) y tasas de mineralización y nitrificación de N. También sugiere que un elemento diferente se convertirá en el principal factor limitante cuando se haya alcanzado la saturación de N. Aunque esta hipótesis ha sido probada en bosques templados, aún no se ha abordado si se pueden aplicar directamente a los bosques tropicales saturados de nitrógeno. Para probar esta hipótesis, el N inorgánico del suelo, la mineralización del N del suelo y la tasa de nitrificación, la tasa de emisión de N2O del suelo y la tasa de lixiviación del nitrato (imagen en línea) se midieron en un bosque tropical saturado de N en el sur de China...
