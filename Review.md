#Big data and the future of ecology

##Massive volumes of data

  1.Ecologistslack a culture of data sharing
  
  2.Treat data as an enduring product of research
  
  3.Basicaly to address large-scale questions
  
##Action items for individual ecologists

  1.Organize, document, and preserve data for posterity
  
  2.Share data
  
  3.Collaborate with networks of colleagues to bring together heterogeneous datasets to address larger scale questions 4.Address data management issues with students and peers
  
  
##Conclusions

  * Ecology can make critical contributions to large-scale environmental questions and close many knowledge gaps that are likely to persist in big-science initiatives, but only if ecologists are willing to participate in the big-data landscape

## Introduction

### An open mind on open data

Scientists who are cautious about open science can start small by sharing data for a project that they have already completed. Specialists in the field offer this advice:

* Document a data-deposition plan while working on publications, so that the data and the paper will be ready for publication at the same time. It is not necessary, however, to release data alongside a paper, unless a funder mandates it.

* Craft a very explicit statement about data reuse â€” including who can use the data, how to use them and how to attribute them.

* Machine-readable data will be most easily combined with other data sets. Avoid proprietary data formats, such as Microsoft spreadsheets, or colour-coded cells that are
readable only by humans.

* Permanently archive data in reputable repositories such as FigShare or Zenodo, not
on a personal website.

* If you choose to share data from a new project, make sure to generate the
relevant metadata as you go. It is very hard to reconstruct important details after the fact. Tools such as those on Zenodo enable researchers to document such details throughout a project, so that all you have to do is flip a switch when you are ready
to share.

### Una frase aleatoria de Good enough practices in scientific computing

An old joke says that doing the research is the first 90% of any project; _writing up is the other 90%_
