# A Review of Open Science and Computational Ecology  

#Big data and the future of ecology
##Massive volumes of data
  1.Ecologistslack a culture of data sharing
  
  2.Treat data as an enduring product of research
  
  3.Basicaly to address large-scale questions
  
##Action items for individual ecologists
  1.Organize, document, and preserve data for posterity
  
  2.Share data
  
  3.Collaborate with networks of colleagues to bring together heterogeneous datasets to address larger scale questions 4.Address data management issues with students and peers
  
  
##Conclusions
  * Ecology can make critical contributions to large-scale environmental questions and close many knowledge gaps that are likely to persist in big-science initiatives, but only if ecologists are willing to participate in the big-data landscape
