###Responses to Data Requests

Total 49 corresponding authors:
  *21 had shared some data with Wicherts et al. 
  *13 corresponding authors failed to respond to the request or any of the two reminders.
  *3 corresponding authors refused to share data either because the data were lost or because they lacked      time to retrieve the data and write a codebook.
  * 12 corresponding authors promised to share data at a later date, but have not done so in the
    past six years (we did not follow up on it). 
    
These authors commonly indicated that the data were not readily available or that they first needed to       write a codebook.
